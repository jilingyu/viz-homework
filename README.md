homework 7
item1.png is the greatest one to explain my data.From item 1, it can be seen that the bmi and bp values are distributed
nearly unformly in all the age and they don't get vary by age a lot.From this picture, it can be seen that also the bmi
in the area that the age is too young or too old is slightly lower than the ages in the middle while the bp for young
part is less than the bp for old people. it means the bp is slightly increasing by age. From item2.png, the pictures
are too small and there is no strong indications between variables. From item3.png, tha age vs sex is too linear and
aligns in 2 straight lines which is not good for analyze. From item4.png,the distributions are not so clearly seen in
this picture, so item1.png is the greatest one to explain the data.
